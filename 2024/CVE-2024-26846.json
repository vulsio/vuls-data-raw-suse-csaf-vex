				"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module\n\nThe module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and\nfreeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization\nbetween nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial\ncommit.\n\nThere is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in\nwait_for_completion, though it does not handling all cases. E.g.\nblktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload\nhangs forever.\n\nIf we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the\nnvme_delete_ctrl path, all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes\ncalling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all\nnvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave\nnvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq\nworkqueue.\n\nWhile at it, remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.",
