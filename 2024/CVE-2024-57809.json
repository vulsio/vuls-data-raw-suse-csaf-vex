				"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDL\n\nThe suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDL\nplatform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):\n\n  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resume\nsequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications to\ncritical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an\nexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:\n\n  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible\n  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944\n\nWithout this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a\nPCIe device is connected.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases]",
