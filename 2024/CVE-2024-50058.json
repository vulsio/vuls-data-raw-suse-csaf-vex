				"text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too\n\nCommit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part\n3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), so\nthe commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that\nprotection, there is an unprotected \"uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);\"\ncall. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the\nreason why we do not see lots of these reports.\n\nOr it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.\n\nUntil the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this\ndereference to the if too.\n\nI got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130.
