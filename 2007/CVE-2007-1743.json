NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue because \"the attacks described rely on an insecure server configuration\" in which the user \"has write access to the document root.\" In addition, because this is dependent on other vulnerabilities, perhaps this is resultant and should not be included in CVE.",
